Adding Triples

We already saw in Loading and saving RDF, how triples can be added with with the parse() function.

Triples can also be added with the add() function:

Graph.add()

    Add a triple with self as context

add() takes a 3-tuple of RDFLib nodes. Try the following with the nodes and namespaces we defined previously:
'''
from rdflib import Namespace
from rdflib import Graph
from rdflib.namespace import RDF, FOAF
from rdflib import URIRef, BNode, Literal

bob = URIRef("http://example.org/people/Bob")
linda = BNode() # a GUID is generated

name = Literal('Bob') # passing a string
age = Literal(24) # passing a python int
height = Literal(76.5) # passing a python float

g = Graph()

g.add( (bob, RDF.type, FOAF.Person) )
g.add( (bob, FOAF.name, name) )
g.add( (bob, FOAF.knows, linda) )
g.add( (linda, RDF.type, FOAF.Person) )
g.add( (linda, FOAF.name, Literal('Linda') ) )

print (g.serialize(format='turtle'))
'''
Navigating Graphs

An RDF Graph is a set of RDF triples, and we try to mirror exactly this in RDFLib, and the graph tries to emulate a container type:
Graphs as Iterators

RDFLib graphs override __iter__() in order to support iteration over the contained triples:
'''
print ('Navigating Graphs')
print ('=================')
for subject,predicate,obj in g:
   if not (subject,predicate,obj) in g:
      raise Exception("Iterator / Container Protocols are Broken!!")
   print  (subject,predicate,obj) 


print ()
print ('Contains check')
print ()

'''Graphs implement __contains__(), so you can check if a 
triple is in a graph with triple in graph syntax:'''


 
if ( bob, RDF.type, FOAF.Person ) in g:
   print ("This graph knows that Bob is a person!")
   
if (bob, None, None) in g:
   print ("This graph contains triples about Bob!")
